# tsschecker  
_tsschecker is a powerful tool to check tss signing status of various devices and iOS versions._

## Features  
* Allows you to get lists of all devices and all iOS/OTA versions for a specific device.
* Can check signing status for default iOS versions and beta ipsws (by specifying a `BuildManifest.plist`)
* Works without specifying any device relevant values to check signing status, but can be used to save blobs when given an ECID and the option `--print-tss-response` (although there are better tools to do this).

tsschecker is not only meant to be used to check signing status, but also to explore Apple's tss servers.
By using all of its customization possibilities, you might discover a combination of devices and iOS versions that is now getting signed but wasn't getting signed before.
